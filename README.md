# Get-started
How to get started with **GuSuper60** organisation if you are a member of this organisation.

Congrats to be selected as a member of **GuSuper60**. We are here to brush up or study **Data Structure and Algorithm** with our Mentor **Sachin sir**.

As our batch is divided into  6-8 member groups,to get started with this organisation **first create a new Team from Team Tab** at orgamisation home page or [click here](https://github.com/orgs/GUSuper60/teams) for your group. Add your group members to this team and the name of this Team should be like **Group-group_no** i.e. for group number 8, it will be **Group-08**

after this creat a new repository at organisation home page or [click here](https://github.com/organizations/GUSuper60/repositories/new) the last character of this repository name should represent your group number i.e. **repository_name-group_number** like `Alex_08` here Alex is your repository name and last two digit represent your group number.
so that it will be easier to understand!!
